2. **Test Early**: Write tests as you implement features
3. **Document Everything**: Keep documentation up-to-date
4. **Performance Awareness**: Consider performance implications early
5. **Security First**: Validate all inputs and secure data access
6. **Modularity**: Keep components loosely coupled and easily testable

### Critical Success Factors
